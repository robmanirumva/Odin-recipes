    There are three basic kinds of rice: short-grain, long-grain, and medium-grain. Among them you'll <br>
     find hundreds of different varieties. Short-grain riceis rounded and plump, with a high starch content <br>
      that makes the grains stick together when cooked, especially if the rice has been milled to make <br>
     white rice.</p>
